Crave Food's Challange

This is an application written in Java that aims to solve Pallet Loading Problem.

The code works in backtrack, it means that when it doesn't find an optimal solution, boxes are removed one by one from last to first in order to repositionate them and try to find the best placement.

Baraly tested, it is sometimes giving more boxes than optimal sulution, and it is due by the repetition of some points.

This is far from being the best solution, its complexity may be O(n^n), and there are already best implementations.
